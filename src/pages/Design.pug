        The molecular structure of AACs causes them to bind to chlorophyll and retain large volumes of oil, 
        resulting in a 20% loss of oil during processing. The irreversible binding between the AACs and 
        <dfn>chlorophyll ~ green pigment</dfn> prevents reuse of the AACs, leading to increased costs for the
        manufacturer. This also increases the amount of waste produced by the system. The waste is mixed into
        animal feed and released into the ecosystem, where it has the potential to alter soil pH and nutrient

        an alternative method of oil-processing that addresses all three issues presented by AACs.

        The current industry ***practices*** for chlorophyll removal from green seed canola oil involve the use 
        of acid-activated clays (AACs). However, AACs are associated with a variety of problems, including 
        product loss, lack of reusability, and environmental concerns.
